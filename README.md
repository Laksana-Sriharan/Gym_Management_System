<b>Gym Management System - Shark Fitness Center (sharkfitnessgym.000webhostapp.com)</b>

In this project, we have developed a consumer website for Shark Fitness Center with the following features:

The website consists of 7 pages in total.
Members can log in, contact the gym admin, check their body mass index, view membership plans, access their profiles, get workout session schedules, and diet plans.
A gallery page offers a walkthrough view of the gym facilities.
New members can register themselves, providing details such as first name, last name, verified email ID, contact number, address, and medical conditions during the registration process.
During registration, users are required to create a password, ensuring compliance with the password policy.
Registered users can update their membership details and cancel their membership at any time.
The system allows access for members and administration employees of Shark Fitness Center 24/7.
The web-based application features a user-friendly interface for faster user adoption.
Scope:

The proposed fitness web-based system comprises several subsystems to achieve its objectives.
<ol>
<li>Member Registration: A registration system automates the membership registration process, capturing key personal information of new clients and saving details in the database.</li>

<li>BMI Calculator: This application allows users to check their Body Mass Index, receiving health feedback from the system. Users input their age, height, and weight, and the system calculates BMI, providing relevant suggestions.</li>

<li>Workout Schedule and Diet Plan: Users enter details such as height, weight, age, or BMI, and the system outputs suitable workout plans and a diet plan recommended by the nutritionist. The workout plan includes exercises, sets, reps, duration, while the diet plan contains meal type, amount, nutrient percentages, and meal consumption times.</li>
</ol>

Tools and Technologies Used:

The implementation phase utilized the following web technologies:
<ul>
<li>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor version 7.4) at the backend for web development.</li>
<li>MySQL as the database management system.</li>
<li>XAMPP (version 7.4.29) as an open-source cross-platform web server.</li>
<li>HTML/HTML5 and CSS for frontend development.</li>
<li>JavaScript (version ES2015) to add interactivity and complex features to the website.</li>
</ul>
Benefits of the Proposed System:

The Shark Fitness Center web-based system offers numerous advantages for both members and administrators:
<ul>
<li>Enhanced management of staff and members.</li>
<li>Improved interactions between the fitness center and members.</li>
<li>Smoother workflow and reduced workload/stress for management.</li>
